Rules for using the code and all files located in this repository:
1. You can completely copy and change my code, as well as take the technology into your projects, but you must indicate me (AVR) as a co-author of your project, or provide a link to this repository on your projectâ€™s website or directly in it itself.
2. Commercial use of this code or technology is prohibited. This is only possible after my permission.
3. If you take my code or technology into your project, then in this case you must provide the source code of your project upon my request.

All the above rules also apply to The Indie Stone studio. My program is not a modification of the game, and therefore does not fall under the modding policy.
